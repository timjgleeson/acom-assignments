What follows is a review of the book Encountering the New Testament: A Historical and Theological Survey, 3rd Edition 2013, by Walter A. Elwell and Robert W. Yarbrough. 

This review is aimed at a 20-something first year bible college student in the 21st century. As a 20-something bible college student myself, I know first hand some of the issues that are faced. The main issue is setting off on this journey of understanding, and adventuring into the New Testament can appear quite daunting. 

This review will give:
* an overview of the textbook
* a detailed look at how the textbook is presented
* a look at the strengths and weaknesses that are present in this textbook, and
* an assessment of the book's place amongst other textbooks

As a student, Encountering the New Testament provides an overview of the entire New Testament. What it provides is as follows:
* A detailed survey of each book within the New Testament, Gospels, Acts, Epistles and Revelations, to provide information for who wrote it, when it was written, who it was written for, key themes that can be encountered in the book, and critical issues that have been or are currently being debated in regards to the book.
* A detailed look at why we should study the New Testament and how others throughout the last 2000 years have looked to interpret and understand the New Testament in the light of their generational thinking. For example, the textbook surveys the way in which the Enlightment period changed the way in which we interpret the New Testament, especially around who Jesus was and what he said.
* Finally, there is detailed information around the period in which the New Testament books where written and the state in which they were being written. For example, the second chapter surveys the Middle East around the days of Jesus and introduces us to the political atmosphere of Israel at that particular time.
Dr. Keith Essex writes this about the 2nd edition of the textbook in comparison to the 1st, "the textbook continues to be  pedagogically sound, visually oriented, with a good introduction to the historical background of the NT and a satisfactory discussion of the purpose, structure, and major themes of each NT book."1 The 3rd edition continues these themes of introducing the New Testament to a first year bible college student.

Each chapter may appear long, but this is not the case. Chapters are not full of pages with just text, rather they are filled with varying amounts of content in different formats. Each chapter begins with an outline and objective to give clear guidelines for what is ahead in the chapter. The contents of each chapter is supplemented with sidebars, focus boxes, and visual aids, such as photos and maps, that provide additional information. Finally, each chapter finishes with key terms, places and people that are referenced throughout the chapter, a summary of the chapter, further readings, and study questions. These learning aids, as the authors call them, are to make the journey of encountering the New Testament through this textbook a "little less daunting". 


One weakness which I have mentioned in passing earlier is the dryness of the book. In recounting the historical and theological aspects of the New Testament, the authors haven't 
A book review website called Goodreads shows us the point of view that some 20-somethings have on this textbook. "This book put me to sleep on a couple of occasions" - Snorkle. There is a dryness to the textbook which in understanding that we are dealing with historical and theological information needs to be understood. The authors do put in effort to continue drawing the reader back into the book through additional material through each chapter, however, the core content will appear dry. 

One strength this textbook has it's ability provide enough understanding of the New Testament to allow the reader to continue questioning. The great thing about this book, if you  able to move past the dryness of the content, is the continual striving to get answers as a reader. Phillip J. Long, a college professor, got this in his review of the same book. He says "the student will have enough understanding of the issues at stake to move on to more advanced studies in the gospels". This is fantastic as it means the reader is prepared for the next level of studies, and being a 20-something first year bible college student, will be a great stepping stone for the years to come.

Another strength of this textbook is that is doesn't presume anything. It truly is a beginners textbook for encountering the New Testament. For me, as a 20-something, not knowing too much about the historical aspects of the New Testament, this textbook gives an understanding of the thought process that has gone into trying to bring context to each of the chapters within the bible. For example, the outline of the gospel of Matthew tell us that the authors are looking at who is writing it, when was it being written, what content is in the gospel, the theological understandings that come from the gospel, and begins to go into the critical issues that have been and are currently faced by those researching this gospel. 

Another book in the same category as Encountering the New Testament is An Introduction to the New Testament by D. A. Carson and Douglas J. Moo. There are two big comparisons when placing the books side by side:
* The size of An Introduction to the New Testament is a much large book compared to Encountering the New Testament. This may be intimidating for first year students. The size of Encountering the New Testament allows for a less intimidating review of the New Testament.
* The page content of An Introduction to the New Testament does not bring gaps or breaks in the text with additional notes like Encountering the New Testament. Again, with pages full of text, An Introduction to the New Testament does have an intimidating feel towards it as a first year student. 
I feel less intimidated by Encountering the New Testament, which makes me want to interact with it me.

Encountering the New Testament gives a first year bible college student a great introduction to the New Testament that doesn't at face value appear intimidating like other books in it's category. It provides a wealth of information, which at times is dry, but there is enough of a variety of content through sidebars, written and visual aids, further readings and questions that keep readers draw in. As a first year bible college student myself, I recommend this book to other students studying the New Testament for the first time to gain contextual understanding of the New Testament during the Greco-Roman period and for how it can relate at the start of the 21st century.
