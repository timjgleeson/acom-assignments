What follows is a review of the book Encountering the New Testament: A Historical and Theological Survey, 3rd Edition 2013, by Walter A. Elwell and Robert W. Yarbrough. 

This review is aimed at a 20-something first year bible college student in the 21st century. As a 20-something bible college student myself, I know first hand some of the issues that are faced. The main issue is setting off on this journey of understanding, and adventuring into the New Testament can appear quite daunting. 

This review will give:
* an overview of the textbook,
* a detailed look at how the textbook is presented,
* a look at the strengths and weaknesses that are present in this textbook, and
* an assessment of the book in comparison to another within the same field.

## Overview

As a student, Encountering the New Testament provides an overview of the entire New Testament. What it provides is as follows:
* A detailed survey of each book within the New Testament, Gospels, Acts, Epistles and Revelations, to provide information for who wrote it, when it was written, who it was written for, key themes that can be encountered in the book, and critical issues that have been or are currently being debated in regards to the book.
* A detailed look at why we should study the New Testament and how others throughout the last 2000 years have looked to interpret and understand the New Testament in the light of their generational thinking. For example, the textbook surveys the way in which the Enlightment period changed the way in which we interpret the New Testament, especially around who Jesus was and what he said.
* Finally, there is detailed information around the period in which the New Testament books where written and the state in which they were being written. For example, the second chapter surveys the Middle East around the days of Jesus and introduces us to the political atmosphere of Israel at that particular time.

Dr. Keith Essex of The Master's Seminary reviewed the 2nd edition and writes this, "the textbook [is] pedagogically sound, visually oriented, with a good introduction to the historical background of the NT and a satisfactory discussion of the purpose, structure, and major themes of each NT book."1 The 3rd edition continues these themes of introducing the New Testament to a first year bible college student.

## Detailed look

Each chapter may appear long, but this is not the case. Chapters are not full of pages with just text, rather they are filled with varying amounts of content in different formats. Each chapter begins with an outline and objective to give clear guidelines for what is ahead in the chapter. The contents of each chapter is supplemented with sidebars, focus boxes, and visual aids, such as photos and maps, that provide additional information. Finally, each chapter finishes with key terms, places and people that are referenced throughout the chapter, a summary of the chapter, further readings, and study questions. These learning aids, as the authors call them, are to make the journey of encountering the New Testament through this textbook a "little less daunting". 

## Strengths and Weaknesses

This textbook wrestles quiet well between centering the survey on the New Testament's message, whilst producing critical problems and uncertainties to the reader. The authors, as mentioned above, analysis the message of each New Testament book whilst providing critical problems that have arisen through others work in both the historical-critical and historical-theological studies of the New Testament. The authors introduce this struggle when looking at Hermeneutical study and write, "may a New Testament suvery legitimately centre on the New Testament's message, or should it focus on critical problems and uncertainties?" Phillip J. Long, a college professor, sums it up, "the student will have enough understanding of the issues at stake to move on to more advanced studies in the gospels." 

This contents of this textbook, without all the additional supplements, is quite dry to read. It is hard to stay focused whilst reading through each topic. Reviews by other 20-something's on Goodreads, a book review website, reveals just this point. Snorkle, a user of the site, writes "this book put me to sleep on a couple of occasions". There is a dryness to the textbook which in understanding that we are dealing with historical and theological information needs to be understood. With the addition of the supplemented material, the authors do attempt to make each chapter engaging. 

## Comparison of Introductory New Testament books

Another book in the same field as Encountering the New Testament is An Introduction to the New Testament by D. A. Carson and Douglas J. Moo. There are two big comparisons :
* The size of An Introduction to the New Testament is a much large book compared to Encountering the New Testament. This may be intimidating for first year students. The size of Encountering the New Testament allows for a less intimidating review of the New Testament.
* The page content of An Introduction to the New Testament does not bring gaps or breaks in the text with additional notes like Encountering the New Testament. Again, with pages full of text, An Introduction to the New Testament does have an intimidating feel towards it as a first year student. 


## Conclusion

Encountering the New Testament gives a first year bible college student a great introduction to the New Testament that doesn't at face value appear intimidating like other introductory New Testament books. It provides a wealth of information, which at times is dry, but there is enough supplementary content to keep readers draw in to the subject.

As a first year bible college student myself, I recommend this book to other students studying the New Testament for the first time to gain contextual understanding of the New Testament during the Greco-Roman period and for how it can relate at the start of the 21st century.
